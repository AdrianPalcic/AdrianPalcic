# My name is Adrian Palcic 👋

I'm a self-taught web developer with a passion for building interactive and user-friendly web applications. I've completed three certifications through FreeCodeCamp, specializing in front-end development, React, and JavaScript. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by building real-world projects and contributing to my GitHub repository. I'm eager to bring my skills to a professional team where I can grow and contribute.
